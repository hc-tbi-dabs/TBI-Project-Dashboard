# TBI-Project-Dashboard

TBI-Project-Dashboard displays information on schedule, milestones, budget, stage and project health for all IP and SF projects at Technology and Business Inovation (TBI). The dashboard was built using R Shiny.

The application consists of:
- [ui.R](https://github.com/hc-tbi-dabs/TBI-Project-Dashboard/blob/master/ui.R) : defines user interface of the application
- [server.R](https://github.com/hc-tbi-dabs/TBI-Project-Dashboard/blob/master/server.R) : defines server components of the application
- [global.R](https://github.com/hc-tbi-dabs/TBI-Project-Dashboard/blob/master/global.R) : loads libraries and data needed for the application
- [functions.R](https://github.com/hc-tbi-dabs/TBI-Project-Dashboard/blob/master/functions.R) : extra functions, dependencies needed

Next steps:
- collect data from PMs
- host the application in the HPFB server
